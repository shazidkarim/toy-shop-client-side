                <h2>Q-1: What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h2>
                <p>ANS-Access Token:An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources on an API server.It is typically issued to a client after a successful authentication process. <br /> Refresh Token: A refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires.It is typically issued alongside the access token during the authentication process. <br /> How they work together:The client initially authenticates with the server using a username/password or other authentication method.Upon successful authentication, the server issues both an access token and a refresh token to the client.The client includes the access token with each API request, allowing it to access protected resources. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the server without requiring the user to log in again. The server verifies the refresh token and, if valid, issues a new access token to the client. </p>

                <h2>Q-2: Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h2>
                <p>ANS- SQL Structured Query Language and NoSQL Not Only SQL databases are two types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, scalability, and use cases. Here is a comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases: <br /> Data Model:SQL: SQL databases use a structured data model based on tables with predefined schemas. Data is organized into rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established through keys.NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph-based. They provide flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data. <br />Query Language: SQL: SQL databases use the SQL language to perform queries, which is a standardized language for relational databases. SQL provides a declarative approach to query and manipulate data, with powerful querying capabilities, including joins and aggregations. NoSQL: NoSQL databases may have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data model. These query languages can vary between different NoSQL databases and may have different syntax and features compared to SQL. <br />Schema Flexibility:SQL: SQL databases have rigid schemas, meaning the structure of the data is defined and enforced by the database schema. Schema changes often require careful planning and migration strategies. NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas, allowing for schema-less or schema-on-read approaches. This flexibility allows for easier handling of evolving data structures and dynamic data models.</p>

                <h2>Q-3: What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h2>
                <p>ANS- Express.js and Nest.js are both popular JavaScript frameworks used for building web applications and APIs. Here Is an overview of each framework: <br />Express.js:Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js.It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs, including routing, middleware support, template engine integration, and handling HTTP requests and responses.Express.js follows a minimalist approach, allowing developers to have more control and flexibility over the application is structure and components.It has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and a rich ecosystem of middleware and extensions. Express.js is suitable for building lightweight, fast, and scalable web applications, ranging from small projects to larger enterprise-level applications. <br /> Nest.js:Nest.js is a progressive, TypeScript-based framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.It is built on top of Express.js and adds an additional layer of structure and organization to the application by introducing a modular architecture and dependency injection. Nest.js leverages TypeScript features, such as decorators and TypeScript metadata, to provide a more robust development experience, including static typing, enhanced tooling, and better maintainability.It promotes the use of decorators, modules, services, and controllers to define application components and their relationships.Nest.js also provides built-in support for features like dependency injection, middleware, routing, authentication, and database integration.</p>

                <h2>Q-4: What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h2>
                <p>ANS- MongoDB is aggregation framework is a powerful feature that allows for advanced data processing and analysis within the database. It provides a set of operators and stages that enable users to perform complex data manipulations, transformations, and aggregations on MongoDB collections. Here is an overview of how the MongoDB aggregation framework works: <br /> Pipeline Concept:The aggregation pipeline conceptually represents a series of stages that process documents in sequence.Each stage takes input documents, performs specific operations, and passes the transformed documents to the next stage.The output of the last stage in the pipeline is the result of the aggregation operation. <br />Stages:The aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages, where each stage represents a specific data processing step.Each stage performs a particular operation on the input documents, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, projecting, joining, and performing mathematical or statistical operations. <br />Operators:MongoDB provides a wide range of operators that can be used within the aggregation pipeline stages to perform various operations on the data.Operators include arithmetic, comparison, logical, array, string, date, and other specialized operators.These operators enable powerful transformations and computations on the data during the aggregation process. <br />Result:The result of the aggregation operation is typically a new set of documents that represent the transformed or aggregated data.The output can be further processed or used for further analysis within the application.</p>
